## For development this can be set to True
# DEBUG=False

## If you are developing locally (with Django not running inside a container),
## set this to False
# DOCKER=True

## The base URL of the Django site, for local development http://127.0.0.1:8200/
SITE_URL=https://url/

## In a production deployment with other base components, this base path should
## be set for portfolio. Can stay empty in local standalone development.
# FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME=/portfolio

## The accepted HTTP Host headers, Django will serve. Defaults to urlparse(SITE_URL).hostname
# ALLOWED_HOSTS=

## In a production environment Django will be deployed behind a nginx proxy.
## For local development, set this to False
# BEHIND_PROXY=True

## The relative path for the Django admin interface
# DJANGO_ADMIN_PATH=admin

## Set up admin notifications and CAS based superusers here
# DJANGO_ADMINS=Full Name <email-with-name@example.com>,anotheremailwithoutname@example.com
# DJANGO_SUPERUSERS=(username1,username2)

## The base url for the CAS server, e.g. https://your.base.domain/cas
# CAS_SERVER=
## Wherever the CAS server should redirect to after successful auth, e.g. /api/v1/swagger
# CAS_REDIRECT_URL=
## Whether to allow only CA-signed certificates. Only set this to False for a local
## dev environment if your (local) CAS server is using a self-signed certificate
# CAS_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE=True

## In a production setup you should set up SMTP account to get notifications
# EMAIL_HOST_USER=
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
# EMAIL_HOST=
# EMAIL_PORT=
# EMAIL_USE_TLS=
# EMAIL_USE_LOCALTIME=
# EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX=[portfolio]

## The domain that should be used for session cookies. Leave empty for a
## standard domain cookie
# SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN=

## Set up CSRF and CORS settings here. For a local development server you
## might want to set CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS to localhost
# CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN=
# CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=
# CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=False
# CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL=False
# CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST=

## The version number of the generated Open API specification

# USER_QUOTA=1073741824

## The database port only needs to be changed, if you are running portfolio
## locally in combination with e.g. showroom also running locally. Then at
## least one of the database container ports needs to be mapped to a different
## value. So use whatever you set in your docker-compose.override.yml for
## portfolio-postgres or leave the comment to use the default:
# POSTGRES_PORT=5432
## The database password has to be the same as the one set in ../../.env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
