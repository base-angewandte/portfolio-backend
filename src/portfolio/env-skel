## set this to False
# DOCKER=True

## The base URL of the Django site, for local development http://127.0.0.1:8200/
SITE_URL=https://url/

## In a production deployment with other base components, this base path should
## be set for portfolio. Can stay empty in local standalone development.
# FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME=/portfolio

## The accepted HTTP Host headers, Django will serve. Defaults to urlparse(SITE_URL).hostname
# ALLOWED_HOSTS=

## In a production environment Django will be deployed behind a nginx proxy.
## For local development, set this to False
# BEHIND_PROXY=True

## The relative path for the Django admin interface
# DJANGO_ADMIN_PATH=admin

## Set up admin notifications and CAS based superusers here
# DJANGO_ADMINS=Full Name <email-with-name@example.com>,anotheremailwithoutname@example.com

## Wherever the CAS server should redirect to after successful auth, e.g. /api/v1/swagger
# CAS_REDIRECT_URL=
## Whether to allow only CA-signed certificates. Only set this to False for a local
## dev environment if your (local) CAS server is using a self-signed certificate
# CAS_VERIFY_CERTIFICATE=True

## In a production setup you should set up SMTP account to get notifications
# EMAIL_HOST_USER=
# EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=
# EMAIL_HOST=
# EMAIL_PORT=
# EMAIL_USE_TLS=
# EMAIL_USE_LOCALTIME=
# EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX=[portfolio]

## The domain that should be used for session cookies. Leave empty for a

# CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=
# CORS_ALLOW_CREDENTIALS=False
# CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL=False
# CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST=

## The API key for the base API of Angewandte
# ANGEWANDTE_API_KEY=

## The following settings are for geocoding locations/addresses.
## By default GND is used to look up places. You can additionally use
## the GeoNames database at geonames.org, if you provide your username for it.
## Or you can instead use only the Pelias cloud service on geocode.earth or a
## self-hosted Pelias service by providing your API key (and in the self-hosted
## case the API URI). For Pelias you can also set a focus point from where to search.
## Our suggestion is to use Pelias for highest accuracy. The PELIAS_SOURCE_NAME
## is used to provide a label for the source.
# GEONAMES_USER=
# PELIAS_API_KEY=
# PELIAS_API_URL=https://api.geocode.earth/v1
# PELIAS_SOURCE_NAME=geocode.earth
# PELIAS_FOCUS_POINT_LAT=48.208126

# USER_QUOTA=1073741824

## The database port only needs to be changed, if you are running portfolio
## locally in combination with e.g. showroom also running locally. Then at
## least one of the database container ports needs to be mapped to a different
## value. So use whatever you set in your docker-compose.override.yml for
## portfolio-postgres or leave the comment to use the default:
# POSTGRES_PORT=5432
## The database password has to be the same as the one set in ../../.env
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
