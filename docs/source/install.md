# Installation Guide

## Development

There are two supported ways to start the development server:

1. Start only the auxiliary services (database, redis, etc.) in docker
   but start the django dev server locally in your virtual env. This
   is the preferred way if you actively develop this application.

2. Start everything inside docker containers. This is the "easy" way
   to start a dev server and fiddle around with it, hot reloading included.
   But you will not have the local pre-commit setup.

In both cases there are some common steps to follow:

- Make sure you have `make` installed (e.g. with `sudo apt install make`
  for Debian based distributions)

- [Install docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
  for your system

- Clone git repository and checkout branch `develop`:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/base-angewandte/portfolio-backend.git
  cd portfolio-backend
  git checkout develop
  ```

- Check and adapt settings (see [Configuration](./configuration.md) for further details about the configuration possibilities):

  ```bash
  # env
  cp env-skel .env
  vi .env

  # django env
  cp ./src/portfolio/env-skel ./src/portfolio/.env
  vi ./src/portfolio/.env
  ```

- Create docker-compose override file:

  ```bash
  cp docker-compose.override.dev.yml docker-compose.override.yml
  ```

Now, depending on which path you want to go, take one of the following two
subsections.

### Everything inside docker

- Make sure that the `DOCKER` variable in `./src/portfolio/.env` is set to
  `TRUE`. Otherwise Django will assume that postgres and redis are accessible
  on localhost ports.

- Now create the docker-compose override file:

  ```bash
  cp docker-compose.override.dev-docker.yml docker-compose.override.yml
  ```

- Start everything:

  ```bash
  make start-dev-docker
  ```

  Alternatively, if make is not installed on your system yet, you can
  also just use `docker-compose` directly:

  ```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build portfolio-redis portfolio-postgres portfolio-lool portfolio-django
  ```

  If you did start the service with the `docker-compose` instead of `make`, you
  might want to do the following to also get Django's debug output:

  ```bash
  docker logs -f portfolio-django-dev
  ```

  To stop all services again, use `make stop` or `docker-compose down`.

### The full developer setup

- Install latest python 3.7 and create virtualenv e.g. via [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [`pyenv-virtualenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)

- Install pip-tools and requirements in your virtualenv:

  ```bash
  pip install pip-tools
  pip-sync src/requirements-dev.txt
  ```

- Install pre-commit hooks:

  ```bash
  pre-commit install
  ```

- Install required packages for media conversion:

  - Debian based Linux distributions

    ```bash
    sudo apt install bc \
      ffmpeg \
      ghostscript \
      imagemagick \
      libmagic-dev \
      webp \
      exiftool
    ```

  - macOS (Installation recommended via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/))

    ```bash
    brew install ffmpeg ghostscript imagemagick webp exiftool
    ```

- Start required services:

  ```bash
  make start-dev
  ```

- Run migration:

  ```bash
  cd src
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Start development server:

  ```bash
  python manage.py runserver 8200
  ```

````{note}
If you are working **on a system with non-US/UK locales** you might use a
number format that uses `,` as decimal separator rather than `.`. In that
case **audio and video conversions will fail** due to an error when `printf` is
used to format the duration. This should not affect the containerised dev
and production setup. To work around this, set the `LC_NUMERIC` environment
variable to `en_US.UTF-8`, e.g. by starting the dev server with the following
command:

```bash
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8" python manage.py runserver 8200
```
````

## Production

- Update package index:

  ```bash
  # RHEL
  sudo yum update

  # Debian
  sudo apt-get update
  ```

- Install docker and docker-compose

- Create and change to user `base`

- Create and change to `/opt/base`

- Clone git repository and checkout branch `master`:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/base-angewandte/portfolio-backend.git
  cd portfolio-backend
  git checkout master
  ```

- Check and adapt settings (see [Configuration](./configuration.md) for further details about the configuration possibilities):

  ```bash
  # env
  cp env-skel .env
  vi .env

  # django env
  cp ./src/portfolio/env-skel ./src/portfolio/.env
  vi ./src/portfolio/.env
  ```

- Use `Makefile` to initialize and run project:

  ```bash
  make start init init-static restart-gunicorn
  ```

- Install nginx and configure it accordingly
